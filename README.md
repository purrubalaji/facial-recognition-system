# facial-recognition-system
A smart and automated attendance tracking system using facial recognition technology. This project leverages Python, OpenCV, and face encoding to detect and verify registered faces, log timestamps, and store attendance records efficiently.

ðŸš€ Key Features
Real-time face detection using OpenCV and Haar cascades

Face encoding and recognition powered by face_recognition library

Automated timestamp logging for each recognized face

User-friendly interface to add new attendees

CSV-based attendance logging for easy export and analysis

ðŸ’¡ Workflow
Face Registration: Capture and store facial images of authorized users

Encoding: Convert images to unique encodings for comparison

Live Detection: Detect faces via webcam in real time

Recognition and Logging: Match faces, mark attendance with timestamps

Storage: Save attendance data in structured CSV format

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
Python (OpenCV, face_recognition)

CSV for data logging

Jupyter Notebook / Flask (optional interface)
